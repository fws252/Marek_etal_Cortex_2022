Analysis code to perform linear SVM decoding on EEG data

This analysis code was used in:
Mares I, Ewing L, Papasavva E, Ducrocq E, Smith FW, Smith MLS (in press).
Face recognition ability is manifest in early dynamic decoding of face-orientation
selectivity â€“ evidence from multi-variate pattern analysis of the neural
response. Cortex.

The code was originally created by Fraser W. Smith 
see Smith, F.W. & Smith M.L.S. (2019). Decoding the dynamic representation of facial expressions of emotion in explicit and incidental tasks. Neuroimage, 195, 261-271.
and was adapted to this project by Ines Mares and Fraser W. Smith.



Code to generate and analyse SVM classifiers of EEG data

create_classifiers.m - first code to run to generate classifiers.
To change the channels used please edit filterSubElecs.m

computeClassParallel.m - computes linear SVM decoding accuracies from the EEG signal either using time windows OR sample by sample

create_matrices.m - organises the classifiers accuracies generated in matrices organised per group  (high vs low CFMT) for ease of plotting.

plotgroupclassifiers.m - generates plots (and group stats) to visually compare classifier accuracy between groups.

individualstatsandgraphs.m - generates individual level stats and plots.
